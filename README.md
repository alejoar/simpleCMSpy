# simpleCMSpy
a minimal CMS made in python

This simple CMS includes a terminal version (main.py) and a web based version (main_web.py) which launchs by default on your localhost:8080.

The web version doesn't have a user verification system yet, whereas the terminal version does. Both share the same database and can be used indistinctively.

I made this program in a few hours mainly to culminate my python lessons and to learn sqlite3 and web.py
